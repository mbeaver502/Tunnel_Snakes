This is the CS 455: Software Engineering term project completed at the University of North Alabama in Spring 2014. The team consisted of [Michael Beaver](https://www.github.com/mbeaver502), [Travis Hunt](https://www.github.com/thunt1), [Andrew Hamilton](https://github.com/aahamilt), Drew Aaron, Chad Farley, and [Clay Boren](https://github.com/clayboren). This software implements a Windows GUI IDE and (partial) emulator of the ASSIST/I assembly language for the IBM 360/370. More information can be found in the [Documents](https://github.com/mbeaver502/Tunnel_Snakes/tree/master/Documents/) folder and specifically in the [project descriptions](https://github.com/mbeaver502/Tunnel_Snakes/tree/master/Documents/Project%20Description).
